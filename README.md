# Don't Eat Me!

Do you like cute things?  Do you like burgurs?  Play as an adorable and delicious little burger and try to survive from all the nasty hungry humans.

### How to play?

To play, load the game. Press the space bar on the start screen to start playing. To move, use the arrow keys. To shoot press the space bar. Ther are two types of humans you are fighting.  Killing the blue and green humans will earn you 1 point per kill.  Killing the multi-colored human will earn you 10 points, but be careful because these guys move!  Also be careful with their saliva acid, it's gross and it will hurt.  You have 30 seconds to complete the game, once time is up you die.  Kill all humans to win.  Good luck!
